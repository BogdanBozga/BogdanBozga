ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bogdan Bozga
I love learning new things, and right now Iâ€™m diving into robotics, AI, ML, and Earth observation. Iâ€™m passionate about applying technology to real-world challenges, whether itâ€™s automating systems, building intelligent robots, or experimenting with satellite data for Earth observation.

Hmm, whatâ€™s next?
Who knowsâ€”Iâ€™m always excited to see where my curiosity takes me!
