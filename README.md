ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bogdan Bozga
I love to learn new things, and right now, Iâ€™m diving into robotics, AI, ML, and Earth observation. I'm passionate about applying technology to real-world challenges, whether itâ€™s in automating systems, building intelligent robots, or experimetning with data from satelites for Earth observation.
Hmm, what's next? Who knowsâ€”I'm always excited to see where my curiosity takes me!
